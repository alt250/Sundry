# this file contains a list of directories which are to be backed up
# it is called from rsync_external.sh script via daily cron job
# important points to note are 
# 1) parent directories must be specified.  eg. Services/ must exist on a line before being able to specify a subdir & files
# 2) in order to backup all files within a directory, each entry must end /***
# 3) entries can be commented out and rsync will not include them
